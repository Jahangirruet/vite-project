                Hardware Resource Scheduling

              <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-black !leading-[1.6]">
                FXVPS.PRO provides virtualized server instances (virtual
                machines or VMs), which are allocated portions of the physical
                hardware resources of host machines. FXVPS.PRO’s virtualization
                platform is designed to guarantee the availability of resource
                allocations provided for each VM; however, it is possible that 1
                VM may abuse system resources by demanding an over-allocation of
                host system resources, in a way that negatively impacts the
                performance of neighboring VMs. Resource allocation and
                utilization will be continuously monitored by FXVPSPRO, in order
                to prevent the possibility of resource abuse. FXVPS.PRO may
                immediately suspend any VM that is seen to be abusing host
                system or network resources in the manner described above.
